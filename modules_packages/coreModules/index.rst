Core Python Modules
===================

In a standard installation of Python, the code modules can be found at :p:`/usr/lib/<pythonVersion>`.  As of October 2022, the current version of Python is 3.10, so the modules can be found at :p:`/usr/lib/python3.10/`. 

The `Python Documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/>`_ website contains information about all the amazing functionality that is built into the Python programming language.
