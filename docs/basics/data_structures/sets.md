# Sets

In Python, a Sets are a unique data type inspired by mathematical sets.  They are a collection of
elements, like a [`list`](./lists.md) or [`dict`](dictionaries.md), but there is
**no ordering** of the elements, and there can be **no duplicate** elements. With that in mind,
it should be clear that the main use of a `set` is to have unique set of values, ideal when
dealing with data prone to duplication, and then [testing membership](membership_testing.md)
against that `set`.

Like mathematical sets, Python sets support operations such as *union*, *insertion*, *difference*,
and *containment*.
