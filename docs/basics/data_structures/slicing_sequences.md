# Slicing Sequences

Slicing is a powerful technique that allows you to extract specific portions of data from
Python sequences such as [lists](lists.md), strings, and [tuples](tuples.md). It provides
you with the ability to finely control what data you need, whether itâ€™s from the beginning,
end, or anywhere in between. This slicing capability is governed by both positive and negative
index systems, making it a versatile tool for data manipulation.

Consider the following index systems for a list:

``` python {title="Indexing Sequences" linenums="1"}
days = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"]
# Positive index system
#   0      1      2      3      4      5      6
# Negative index system
#  -7     -6     -5     -4     -3     -2     -1
print(days[-2])
print(days[2])
```

Results in:

``` bash
Saturday
Wednesday
```

Easily access specific portions of a list using slicing. For example, to access the 2nd, 3rd,
and 4th items of a list named days, you can use the following code:

``` python {title="Slicing Lists" linenums="1"}
days = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"]
sliced_days = days[1:4]
print(sliced_days)
```

Would output:

``` bash
['Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday']
```

Retrieve the first three items of a list by simply omitting the starting index:

``` python {title="Retrieving First 3 Items in a List" linenums="1"}
days = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"]
first_three_days = days[:3]
print(first_three_days)
```

Would result in:

``` bash
['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday']
```

To get the last three items, you can use negative indexing:

``` python {title="Negative Slicing of Lists" linenums="1"}
days = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"]
last_three_days = days[-3:]
print(last_three_days)
```

Outputs:

``` bash
['Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday']
```

For everything except the last item, exclude it by slicing until one element from the end:

``` python {title="Exclude the Last Item in a List" linenums="1"}
days = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"]
everything_but_last = days[:-1]
print(everything_but_last)
```

Results in:

``` bash
['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday']
```

Similarly, you can exclude the last two items:

``` python {title="Exclude the Last 2 Items in a List" linenums="1"}
days = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"]
everything_but_last_two = days[:-2]
print(everything_but_last_two)
```

Returns:

``` bash
['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday']
```

## Slicing Strings and Tuples

Strings and tuples share the same slicing principles as lists. You can effortlessly extract
portions of text from a string or elements from a tuple using slicing. For example, consider
this example:

``` python {title="Slicing Strings" linenums="1"}
text = "Hello, World!"
sliced_text = text[7:12]
print(sliced_text)
```

Would output:

``` bash
World
```
