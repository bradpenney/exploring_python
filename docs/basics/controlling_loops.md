# Controlling Loops

Loops in Python are great for repetition ‚Äî but sometimes, you need to take control.
Maybe you want to **skip ahead**, **stop early**, or **do something special at the end**.
That‚Äôs where the loop control keywords `continue`, `break`, and `else` come in.

This guide explores how these keywords work and shows you how to use them effectively ‚Äî
with a few playful examples along the way.


## Continuing a Loop
Sometimes, we want to skip over part of a loop's work for a particular iteration without stopping
the whole thing.  That‚Äôs where `continue` comes in ‚Äî it tells the loop:
*‚ÄúSkip the rest of this turn, move on to the next!‚Äù*

``` python
colours = ["red", "green", "blue", "orange"]

for colour in colours:
    if colour == "orange":
        print("Ugh, orange again? Let's pretend we didn't see that.")
        continue
    print(f"Ooooh, I totally dig the colour {colour}!")

```

Would result in:
``` bash
Ooooh, I totally dig the colour red!
Ooooh, I totally dig the colour green!
Ooooh, I totally dig the colour blue!
Ugh, orange again? Let's pretend we didn't see that.
```

??? tip

    Often, continue can be replaced by simply using an if statement to wrap the block of code.
    For example: if colour != "orange": print(...) would achieve the same result.
    That said, continue can be helpful for readability ‚Äî just use it mindfully.

## Breaking a Loop
Sometimes, we want to stop a loop entirely when something important happens.
This is known as *abnormal termination*, and the `break` statement is your go-to tool.

In the example below, we simulate a bank account that refuses to go into the red:

``` python
balance = 100
withdrawals = [10, 23, 12, 16, 43, 19, 4, 5]

for withdrawal in withdrawals:
    print(f"üì§ Request to withdraw ${withdrawal}...")

    if (balance - withdrawal) < 0:
        print("üö® Uh-oh! You're broke. No more money magic today.")
        break

    balance -= withdrawal
    print(f"‚úÖ Success! You withdrew ${withdrawal}. Remaining balance: ${balance}")
```

Would result in:

``` bash
üì§ Request to withdraw $10...
‚úÖ Success! You withdrew $10. Remaining balance: $90
üì§ Request to withdraw $23...
‚úÖ Success! You withdrew $23. Remaining balance: $67
üì§ Request to withdraw $12...
‚úÖ Success! You withdrew $12. Remaining balance: $55
üì§ Request to withdraw $16...
‚úÖ Success! You withdrew $16. Remaining balance: $39
üì§ Request to withdraw $43...
üö® Uh-oh! You're broke. No more money magic today.
```

Like the `continue` statement, `break` should also be used with caution.  In the example above
the same funtionality could have been achieved with a `while` loop.  Use with discretion!

### Using Else with For Loops
One of Python‚Äôs lesser-known features is the ability to attach an `else` block to a loop.
This block will run *only if the loop completes naturally* ‚Äî that is, not interrupted by a
`break`.

Here‚Äôs a playful example that builds on our earlier scenario:

``` python
balance = 200
withdrawals = [10, 23, 12, 16, 43, 19, 4, 5]

print("üí∏ Time for a little shopping adventure!")

for withdrawal in withdrawals:
    print(f"üõí You spot something for ${withdrawal}...")

    if (balance - withdrawal) < 0:
        print("üò± Your wallet gasps in horror ‚Äî not enough cash!")
        print("üíÄ The spree ends here, friend.")
        break

    balance -= withdrawal
    print(f"üéâ Purchase successful! You‚Äôve got ${balance} left in your treasure chest.")
else:
    print("üéä You made it through your spree without going broke!")
```

Would result in:

``` bash
üí∏ Time for a little shopping adventure!
üõí You spot something for $10...
üéâ Purchase successful! You‚Äôve got $190 left in your treasure chest.
üõí You spot something for $23...
üéâ Purchase successful! You‚Äôve got $167 left in your treasure chest.
üõí You spot something for $12...
üéâ Purchase successful! You‚Äôve got $155 left in your treasure chest.
üõí You spot something for $16...
üéâ Purchase successful! You‚Äôve got $139 left in your treasure chest.
üõí You spot something for $43...
üéâ Purchase successful! You‚Äôve got $96 left in your treasure chest.
üõí You spot something for $19...
üéâ Purchase successful! You‚Äôve got $77 left in your treasure chest.
üõí You spot something for $4...
üéâ Purchase successful! You‚Äôve got $73 left in your treasure chest.
üõí You spot something for $5...
üéâ Purchase successful! You‚Äôve got $68 left in your treasure chest.
üéä You made it through your spree without going broke!
```

Using else in loops isn‚Äôt especially common, but when used well, it can express logic cleanly ‚Äî
particularly in search loops, or when you want to take special action only if no early exit
occurred.
