    "# Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples, similar to [lists](./lists.ipynb), provide a means to collect and organize data. However, what sets tuples apart is their immutability - once created, the elements within a tuple cannot be modified. In this guide, we'll delve into what tuples are, explore why they are used, and demonstrate some practical use cases for these unchangeable data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "A tuple is a collection of elements, just like a list, but it differs in a crucial way: it cannot be changed or altered once it is declared. This immutability makes tuples an ideal choice for situations where you want to ensure that the data remains constant throughout your program's execution. Think of tuples as containers for values that should remain fixed, such as the results obtained from a database SELECT statement in SQL. These results might be crucial to your Python program, but you want to guarantee their integrity and prevent any unintentional modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a tuple in Python is quite straightforward. Instead of using square brackets, as you would with a list, you use parentheses to define a tuple. Here's how you can create tuples to store server names and ages:"
