# Lists

Lists are one of the most useful data types in Python - they are used extensively throughout most Python programs.  Lists consist of a mutable (changable) array of values:

```{code-cell} ipython3
users = ["Jim", "Dwight", "Michael"]
distanceInKms = [32, 97, 51, 403, 21, 53, 81]
mixedTypes = ["Jim", 23, 3.14, True, "Berzerk"]
```

Lists can be sliced, see [Slicing](../slicing/index.html) for more details.
