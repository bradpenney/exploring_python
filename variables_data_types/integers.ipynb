    "In Python (as most programming languages), numbers are treated differently than [`strings`](./strings.md).  They are interpreted as numbers, therefore standard mathematical operations can be performed on them.  Integers are whole numbers (as opposed to [`floats`](./floats.md)).  Any two integers can be declared and then used mathematically. \n",
