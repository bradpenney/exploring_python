# `while` Loops


Another option is :p:`while-loops`. The code under a :p:`while-loop` will run as long as the while-loop condition is :p:`True`:

.. code-block:: python

    while datetime.datetime.now() < datetime.datetime(2090, 8, 20, 19, 30, 20):
        print("It's not yet 19:30:20 of 2090.8.20")

The loop above will print out the string inside :p:`print()` over and over again until the 20th of August, 2090.
