    "# `if-elif-else` Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of programming, decision-making is a fundamental concept, and the `if-elif-else` statement in Python is a powerful tool for precisely that purpose. These statements allow you to create dynamic, branching logic within your programs. With them, you can instruct your code to take different actions based on specific conditions, making your programs more intelligent and responsive.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an if-elif-else Statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "An `if-elif-else` statement is a control structure in Python that enables your program to make choices. It starts with an `if` statement, which checks a particular condition. If that condition is true, a specific block of code is executed. However, if the condition is not met, the program can continue to evaluate other conditions using `elif` (short for \"else if\") statements. These \"elif\" clauses allow for multiple conditions to be checked sequentially. Finally, if none of the preceding conditions are true, the `else` block of code is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it Used?\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of `if-elif-else` statements is to introduce decision-making capabilities into your code. They allow your program to adapt and respond to varying situations. For example, you might use `if-elif-else` statements to implement logic like:\n",
