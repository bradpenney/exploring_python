# `if` Statements


Ubiquitous in nearly all programming languages, the `if` statement is the foundational way programs make decsions.  A condition is evaluated, and then a particular action is taken depending on the outcome of the evaluation.  For example:

```python
name = "Brad"

if name == "Brad":
    print(f"Hey {name}")
```

## `if/else` Statements

```python
name = "Jim"

if name == "Brad":
    print(f"Hello {name}")
else:
    print(f"Greetings {name}")
```
