    "The `if` statement is a basic building block of nearly all programming languages.  It is how a program decides a course of action - *if* this condition is met, *then* perform this action.  If the condition isn't met (if something didn't happen), then perform a different action (or do nothing).  Here's a basic example:"

So if the grade falls in the 60-79 range, the user will receive the message \"You have passed this class, good job\".  Another option would be to use an `or` statement, meaning that if either condition is met, this `elif` statement will work.  This strategy can be used in either `if` or `elif` statements.\n",

This means that even if a condition in a later statement is also true, it won't be executed because Python will ignore later statements once it finds a true statement.
