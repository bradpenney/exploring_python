# Control Statements

Control statements are how programs make decisions based on inputs either from the end-user or from data that is collected by the program.

### Logic

Code makes decisions using logic.

- [`if` Statements](./if_statements.md)

### Looping

Code repeats its actions a specific number of times or until a specific condition is met using loops.

- [`for` Loops](./for_loops.md)
- [`while` Loop](./while_loops.md)
- [Looping over a Function](./looping_over_a_function.md)

```python

```
